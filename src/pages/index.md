      Hey there I’m Reshav Pandey a 16 year old high school kid. I’m a growth
      marketer, currently pursuing my Growth Marketing mini-degree from CXL. 




      I’m a learner and therefore I love sharing my notes on growth, marketing,
      startups, philosophy and some other nerdy stuff. 




      All the information I share is my attempt to document my journey and help
      other learning enthusiasts.
